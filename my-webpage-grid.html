                        Paris is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. It is known worldwide for the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame cathedral, and the Eiffel tower. It has a reputation of being a romantic and cultural city. The city is also known for its high-quality gastronomy and the terraces of its caf√©s.
                        For that reason I would love to visit Paris because I love food and Paris is known as a food paradise, thats what mostly interest me about it. Another thing is that my favourite player in the world now plays for Paris Saint German a team from Paris in France.

                                In 1652, the Dutch East India Company(DEIC) settled on the shores of Table bay to establish a refreshment base for ships en route from Europe to East Asia.
                                Built by the DEIC between 1666 and 1679, the Castle of Good is the oldest existing colonial bulding in South Africa.
                                During the second Boer war(1899-1902) part of the castle was used as a prison and the former cells remain.
